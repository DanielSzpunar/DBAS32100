SQL Statements:

SELECT * FROM Customers;
Customers is the table the statement will use.
SELECT * FROM customers means select all (*) records from the "Customers" table.

Semicolons are not used in all versions of sql.  However,
we will use semicolons.

SQL SELECT:
the select statement is used to select data from a database.

SELECT Address FROM Customers;
will return all the Address records from Customers.

SELECT CustomerName, City From Customers;
will return both CustomerName and City from the customer database.

SELECT FieldYouWantToSee FROM TableName;
SELECT FieldYouWantToSee FROM TableName;
SELECT FieldYouWantToSee FROM TableName;
SELECT FieldYouWantToSee FROM TableName;
SELECT FieldYouWaNtToSee FROM TableName;

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

This will return all different Country entries from the database.
So, for example, if two customers are from Canada the output
will only show one Canada. Without DISTINCT the output would show 
two Canada.

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
This will return the total amount of distinct (different) countries in the list.

SQL WHERE:
WHERE is used to filter records. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

For example,
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Real world example:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'MEXICO';
This will return all data from the database where country matches 

The Following operators can be used in the WHERE clause.
= Equal
<> Not Equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
BETWEEN Between an inclusive range.
LIKE search for a pattern
IN To specify multiple possible values for a column.

Where can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT.
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one 
condition.

AND all conditions must be met.
OR any of the conditions must be met.

The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

AND SYNTAX
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City= 'BERLIN'; 

OR SYNTAX
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Toronto' OR City= 'Mississauga';

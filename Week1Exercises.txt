/*To review some of the SQL statements you have learned in Database
Design and Implementation and get familiar with HR, SH and SI
databases, try the following exercises:
1. Using HR database find out:
a) How much does Amit Banda earn?
b) What are the addresses of the company locations in Tokyo?
c) What is the difference between max_salary and min_salary for the president of
the company?
2. Using SH database show:
 How many promotion categories are there.
3. Using SI database
Who are the customers that are interested in buying 2016 Jaguar XE
